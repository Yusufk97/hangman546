## Project Description
This project is a simple Python script that demonstrates the use of lists, random selection, and user input validation. The script performs the following tasks:
- Creates a list of your favorite fruits.
- Selects a random fruit from the list.
- Prompts the user to guess a letter.
- Validates the user input to ensure it is a single alphabetical character.

The aim of this project is to practice basic Python programming concepts, including working with lists, using the `random` module, and handling user input with validation. Through this project, you will learn how to:
- Create and manipulate lists in Python.
- Use the `random.choice` method to select a random item from a list.
- Get and validate user input using the `input` function and conditional statements.
